## U.S. Legislators Contact Info Alexa Skill ##

**Name:** U.S. Legislators Contact Info

**Invocation Name:** legislators contact info

## Why? ##

This work is a result of a demo I attended. It inspired me to create an Alexa Skill. I decided to take the current U.S. Congress and create a contact info skill.
